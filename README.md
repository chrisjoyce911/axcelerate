# axcelerate-go [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/chrisjoyce911/axcelerate.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/chrisjoyce911/axcelerate) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/multiplay/go-battleye.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisjoyce911/axcelerate)

Provides a simple interface to theRESTFul API for interfacing with aXcelerate.

## Usage

## Roadmap

This library is being initially developed for use with the [aXcelerate RESTFul Service API](https://admin.axcelerate.com.au/apidocs/), so API methods will likely be implemented in the order that they are needed by any project that accesses this service.

## Contributing

I would like to cover the entire aXcelerate RESTFul Service API and contributions are of course always welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
